        <h1>The Denver Omelet</h1>
        <img src="../img/denver-omelet.png" alt="The Denver Omelet">

        <h2>Denver omelet, also called western omelet, 
            an omelet with ham, onion, and bell pepper; 
            cheese is sometimes included.</h2>

        <p> Historians have speculated that the dish 
            was originally served on bread as a sandwich, 
            created by 19th-century cattle drivers in the 
            American West or by Chinese railroad cooks as 
            a sort of transportable egg foo yong. </p>

        <p>At some point a breadless version was developed, 
            and it became known as the Denver (or western) omelet. 
            The sandwich variety, called a Denver (or western) sandwich, 
            is still common. The Denver omelet is a change of pace 
            from a French omelet and is known for its firmer texture and 
            caramelized flavor. Make it a complete lunch or dinner with 
            arugula salad and toasted bread.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>¼ cup diced smoked ham</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons diced onion</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons diced green bell pepper</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>⅓ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat eggs in a small bowl until just combined; do not over-beat.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add ham, onion, 
                and bell pepper; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until 
                onions soften and ham begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in eggs. Mix briefly with 
                a spatula while shaking the pan to ensure ingredients are evenly 
                distributed. Quickly run the spatula along edges of omelet. 
                Sprinkle Cheddar cheese and cayenne pepper over omelet.</li>
            <li>Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until top is still wet
                 but not runny, about 5 minutes. Use a spatula to fold omelet 
                 in half and transfer it to a plate.</li>
        </ol>
