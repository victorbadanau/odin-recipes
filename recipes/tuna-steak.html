        <h2>Tuna is an exceptionally mild-flavored fish, 
            making it ideal for taking on the flavors of a marinade.</h2>
        <p>This tuna steak recipe uses a 
            tangy marinade made with orange juice, 
            soy sauce, and garlic for a wonderful taste.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup orange juice</li>
            <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon chopped fresh oregano</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 (4 ounce) tuna steaks</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix orange juice, soy sauce, olive oil, parsley, 
                lemon juice, garlic, oregano, and pepper together 
                in a large non-reactive dish until well combined. 
                Place tuna steaks in marinade and turn to coat. 
                Cover the dish with plastic wrap and marinate in the 
                refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly 
                oil the grate. Remove tuna steaks from the marinade 
                and shake off excess; reserve marinade for basting.</li>
            <li>Cook tuna steaks on the preheated grill for 5 to 6 minutes; 
                flip steaks and baste with reserved marinade. 
                Cook for an additional 5 minutes, or to desired doneness. 
                Discard any remaining marinade.</li>
        </ol>
